# GUMS: Graph User Management System

## Introduction
This project is a spring application that provides a reactive REST API for managing users and projects linked to them.
The application stores data in the NoSQL MongoDB.

## Details
The application is meant to be a toy project that plays with spring, in particular, the project uses:
- Spring IoC
- Spring Data
- Spring AOP
- Spring webMVC
- Spring Security
- JUnit 5
- Mockito
- MongoDB
- Lombok
- Maven
- Github action

The choice of not using spring boot is intentional, the goal is to understand how spring works under the hood.

## TODO
- Move to reactive implementation
- Build UI with Three.js
- Add docker support and export as a docker image
